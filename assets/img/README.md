This directory contains the local site logo provided by the maintainer: `logo.png`.

Guidance:

- The site now references `assets/img/logo.png` as the primary header logo.
- If you want to replace it with a different file, place the new image at `assets/img/logo.png` (or update the `<img src>` paths in the HTML if you prefer a different name).
- Keep images reasonably sized for performance (try to keep header logos under 200 KB where possible).

If you'd like me to add additional sizes (e.g., @2x) or rename the file, tell me and I can add those files and update the HTML accordingly.
